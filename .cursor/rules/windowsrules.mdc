* POWERSHELL: I code on Windows. All terminal commands are run in PowerShell. Hence commands like "&&" do not work on PowerShell. Please raplace them with ";".

* CI/CD: ssh and scp do not work on this PC. They are bloked by the firewall of my company. That's why I only use Github action workflow to push my code to production.
