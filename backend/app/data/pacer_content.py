        The PACER methodology is a comprehensive framework for complex B2B sales, 
        especially suited for payment processing solutions. It provides a structured 
        approach to navigate the entire sales cycle from prospecting to customer retention.
        
        The methodology consists of five sequential stages:
        - Prospect: Identify and qualify potential customers
        - Assess: Understand customer needs and pain points
        - Challenge: Present insights and solutions that challenge the status quo
        - Execute: Navigate complex buying processes and close deals
        - Retain: Maintain and grow customer relationships

                Dear [Name],
                
                Our recent research with similar retailers showed that optimizing payment flows 
                resulted in a 12% increase in completed transactions. 
                
                Many retailers like yours are facing challenges with cart abandonment and 
                cross-border payment acceptance. I'd like to share some industry-specific 
                insights that have helped our retail clients address these challenges.
                
                Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how these approaches might 
                apply to RetailCo's payment strategy?
